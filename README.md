# Self-intro of moi!
## I am **Emmanuella!** I am a sophomore and double major in *Journalism and Africana Studies.* I am an editor for The Brown and White and want to become an investigative journalist! Some fun facts about me include that I have been writing since the first grade, I do not know how to ride a bicycle (not so fun when everyone else knows how to), and I am the choreographer for our school's African dance team.
