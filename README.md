# Self-intro of moi!
## I am **Emmanuella!** I am a sophomore and double major in *Journalism and Africana Studies.* I am an editor for The Brown and White and want to become an investigative journalist! Some fun facts about me include that I have been writing since the first grade, I do not know how to ride a bicycle (not so fun when everyone else knows how to), and I am the choreographer for our school's African dance team.

# Homework Assignment
## Black Women and Mortality Rates in America
This data provides an in-depth look into the mortality rates in America and how they differ when looking at specific races. The data shows that among non-Hispanic Black women, Hispanic women, and White women, non-Hispanic Black women have the highest mortality rates during childbirth. These findings are quite profound, especially when examining them from 2018-2021 because we see the mortality rates increasing. Through this data, we can continue to investigate why this happens.
